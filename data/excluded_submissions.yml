# Examining duplicate_checklist_comparison reveals the following duplicate 
# checklist ID's that can be removed:
- S6659296  # route 5
- S23439664 # route 5
- S6659658  # route 10, 2005
- S70173514 # Durham 01, 2019

# as well as the following paired checklists which are problematic and should be 
# independently investigated:
#
# Route 4: 2005, S6659351/S6659606 (of these two, I get the impression of one 
# list by an experienced birder, and one list by a less experienced birder; 
# I would trust S6659351 and drop S6659606); 
- S6659606
# Route 5: 2005, S23455267/S6659305/S6659365 (only difference is BLGR; 
# keep S23455267 (5 BLGR, Will Cook's checklist)
#                & drop S6659305, S6659365 (7 BLGR); none of them have comments
- S6659305
- S6659365

#          2007, S23439679/S6653243 (keep S6653243, drop S23439679); 
- S23439679
#          2008, S23439662/S6659533 (keep S23439662 which has unexpected 
#                Glossy Ibis rec, reported to The Chat, drop S6659533); 
- S6659533
#          2009, S23439661/S6659581 (keep S23439661 which has everything the same
#                as the other checklist, plus a few more species, drop S6659581);
- S6659581
# Route 6: 2008, S6653290/S8323435 (notes from S8323435: "note=woodcocks flew 
#                over our heads at our second stop at about 5:45am",
#                one checklist includes the woodcock, the other does not; 
#                I assume the woodcock did not fly over during the 3-minute count,
#                but this could be confirmed with Robin Moran / Judy Murray; 
#                in that case drop S8323435; other difference is # vehicles 51 vs 102--weird); 
- S8323435

# Route 12: 2013, S14314705/S14314588; 2014, S18727169/S18727091; 2015, S24083367/S24083590;
#           2016, S46295712	S46295165; 2018, S46295712/S46295165
#           (all of these for Route 12 likely represent the 3 extra pre-dawn stops for owling which 
#           are filtered out by grepl("night birds preceding", Checklist.Comments))
