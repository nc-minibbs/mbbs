# Sometimes stop-level data is missing when in fact route was surveyed
# and stop-level data was collected for the rest of the route.
#
# This deviation could be for 2 reasons:
# 1) The observer(s) were unable to access the stop for safety or other reasons.
#    In this case, we do not know the bird count.
# 2) The stop was in fact observed, 
#    but no birds were seen.
#    The eBird download does not contain the empty checklist.
#    In this case, we do know the count of all species is 0.
#
# This file tracks these cases.
