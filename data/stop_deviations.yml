# Sometimes stop-level data is missing when in fact route was surveyed
# and stop-level data was collected for the rest of the route.
# This file tracks these such deviations.
#
# Deviations could be for 2 reasons:
#
# 1) stops_skipped:
#    The observer(s) were unable to access the stop(s) 
#    for safety or other reasons.
#    In this case, we do not know the bird count.
# 2) stops_nobirds
#    The stop(s) were in fact observed, 
#    but no birds were seen.
#    The eBird download does not contain the empty checklist.
#    In this case, we do know the count of all species is 0.
