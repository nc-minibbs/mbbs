For example, on the first route I heard a song I could not identify but Merlin was picking up Kentucky Warbler. I then listened to Sibley's version of the Kentucky Warbler and it matched. Thus, I counted the KEWA. Sometimes, Merlin picked up things I am familiar with but if I did not hear it, I did not include it."
